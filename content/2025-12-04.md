 21
January: In order to make the process of translating
FreeBSD's
official articles and books more accessible to new
contributors, the project is adopting Weblate as its web-based continuous
localization platform. This tool has been in use for some months by
some of our translation teams (pt_BR, es_ES and zh_CN) and due to
the excellent results obtained and the maturity of the workflow
adopted, we believe we are ready to open it to new collaborators.
With the adoption of this new tool the translation process has
become quite simple, and anyone willing to donate a few minutes to
the project can contribute to it! If you are interested in
contributing to the documentation project by translating official
documents you can get more information at our wiki and by
reading the 
announcement sent to freebsd-translators list.

March: The FreeBSD Project is pleased to announce its
participation in Google's 2016 Summer of Code program, which funds
summer students to participate in open source projects. This will
be the FreeBSD Project's twelfth year in the program, having
mentored over 180 successful students through summer-long coding
projects between 2005 and 2015. Past successful projects have
included improvements to Linux ABI emulation, NFSv4 ACLs, TCP
regression testing, FUSE file system support, and countless other
projects. Many students go on to become FreeBSD developers, as well
as participating in FreeBSD developer events around the world
through continuing support from the FreeBSD Foundation. Prospective
participants are invited to apply; more information is available,
including proposal and deadline information, on the FreeBSD Summer
Projects page.

June: FreeBSD celebrated its 20th
birthday today. On June 19, 1993, Jordan Hubbard, Rod Grimes,
and David Greenman announced to the world the creation of their new
fork of the BSD 4.3 operating system. FreeBSD was derived from the
386BSD 0.1 release from Bill and Lynne Jolitz with its 1.0 release
in Nov 1993. Its stated goals were to create a fast, stable,
reliable server OS for i386 systems. Since then, it has become the
backbone of countless products and has grown to supporting 64bit
computing, embedded devices, and desktop users.

Subversion nowadays. By February 28th 2013, the FreeBSD ports tree

All users who use CVS, CVSup or csup(1) to update the ports tree
are encouraged to switch to portsnap(8) or for users which need
more control over their ports collection checkout, use Subversion
directly. More information are available in the announcement mail
on the 
FreeBSD ports announce mailing list. A migration guide from
CVSup or csup(1) to portsnap(8) is also available in 
the FreeBSD Handbook.

November: On Sunday 11th of November, an intrusion was
detected on two machines within the FreeBSD.org cluster. We have
found no evidence of any modifications that would put any end user
at risk. However, we do urge all users to read the report available
at https://www.freebsd.org/news/2012-compromise.html
and decide on any required actions themselves.

projects between 2005 and 2010. Past successful projects have
included improvements to Linux ABI emulation, NFSv4 ACLs, TCP
regression testing, FUSE file system support, and countless other
projects. Many students go on to become FreeBSD developers, as well
as participating in FreeBSD developer events around the world
through continuing support from the FreeBSD Foundation. Prospective
participants are invited to apply; more information is available,
including proposal and deadline information, on the FreeBSD Summer
Projects page.
